## Server

The server exposes the 3 most recent news stories mentioning SNOW published in the past 3 days.

Details:
- Hosted at `localhost:8282` by default, and exposes a single endpoint, `/news`.
- Pulls data from finnhub.io's API. Specifically, it hits the `/api/v1/company-news` endpoint. See https://finnhub.io/docs/api/company-news.
- Serves cached data. The cache is updated once every minute.

## Improvements

Potential future improvements to this server:
- Allow for querying news from any company ticker (using query parameter)
- Allow for querying other types of information (stock price, market news)

Potential future code improvements:
- Add unit testing
- Add integration test
- Create Collector interface for different types of collectors (News, StockPrice, MarketNews, etc.)
